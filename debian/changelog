cargo (0.17.0-1~exp2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Bring in some changes from Ubuntu.

      cargo-vendor output in that way.
  * Document that bootstrap.py probably doesn't work now.
  * Include /usr/share/rustc/architecture.mk in d/rules instead of duplicating
    awkward arch-dependent Makefile snippets.
